📸 SolanaStock: Decentralized Stock Photo Marketplace

This is our submission for the 2023 Solana Hyperdrive hackathon as team NumberBoost.com :)

SolanaStock is a decentralized stock photo marketplace that lets anybody monetize their photos. Everyone has photos worth buying. We use TensorFlow with state-of-the-art AI that runs client-side to Zero Knowledge index photos without revealing them before payment.

🌟 Overview
SolanaStock is a unique platform designed for photographers, artists, and anyone with a flair for capturing moments. It empowers you to monetize your photos by selling them as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). When someone purchases your photo NFT on SolanaStock, they acquire the rights to use the photo, all while ensuring authenticity, ownership, and rights are managed transparently on the Solana blockchain. We use Zero Knowledge Proofs with client-side artificial intelligence using TensorFlow.js to index your photos so you don't have to upload them (and pay for hosting!) until someone buys. It's essentially a kind of decentralized stock photo bittorrent that uses AI for search.

🔐 Safety & Authenticity
All photos uploaded to SolanaStock are minted as NFTs on the Solana blockchain. This ensures:

Proof of Authenticity: Every photo NFT has a unique identifier proving its originality.
Immutable Ownership: Once minted, the ownership details cannot be tampered with.
Secure Transactions: All transactions are secured by the underlying robustness of the Solana blockchain.
❓ Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I delete my photo after uploading it?
A: Once your photo is minted as an NFT and listed, it cannot be deleted from the blockchain. However, you can delist the photo from the SolanaStock marketplace if it hasn't been sold.
Q: How are royalties set up?
A: When setting up your photo for listing, you can specify a royalty percentage. Every time the photo NFT is resold, you'll receive that percentage of the sale price.
