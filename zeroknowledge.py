# Idea for using an object detection model to categorize photos without revealing their content.

# High-Level Blueprint:

# Photo Owner (Photographer):

# Uses an object detection model locally to classify images and generate tags.
# Generates watermarked or downsampled thumbnails of these images.
# Creates a proof that the original image belongs to the stated category/tag without revealing the image itself. This proof is generated using a Zero Knowledge Proof system.
# Uploads the proof, the tags, and the thumbnails to the SolanaStock marketplace.
# Potential Buyer:

# Searches the SolanaStock marketplace using tags or categories.
# Sees watermarked/downsampled thumbnails.
# If interested, the buyer initiates a purchase.
# Upon Purchase:

# Photo owner uploads the high-res, unwatermarked image directly to the buyer or through a secure, encrypted channel set up by the marketplace.
# Payment is processed on the Solana blockchain.
